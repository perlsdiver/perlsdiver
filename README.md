### Hello 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Ph.D. in Social Welfare and Interactive Technology and Pedagogy at the [CUNY Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/) in New York City.
- 📜 I have a Bachelor's degree in the humanities (East Asian Studies, Cultural Studies, World Religions) and a Master's degree in Social Work (focusing on Organizational Management and Leadership).
- 👯 I have taught graduate courses on social policy, capstone projects, social work field education, and digital skills.
- 🔬 I research the intersections of human service organizations, emerging technologies, and social theory. Right now I am mainly focused on my coursework and my qualifying exams.

- ⚗️ I'm curious about data visualization, digital art, and design.
- 🌱 Over the last several years I've learn a mix of programming (JavaScript, R, Python), research methods, and how to develop a sustainable system for balancing an endless avalanche of work and projects.
