### Hello 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Ph.D. in Social Welfare at [The CUNY Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/) in New York City.
- 📜 I have a Bachelor's degree in the humanities (East Asian Studies, Cultural Studies, World Religions), a Master's degree in Social Work (Organizational Management and Leadership), and an Advanced Certificate in Interactive Technology.
- 👯 I teach graduate courses on social policy, capstone projects, social work field education, and workshops digital skills (HTML, CSS, Git/Github).
- 🔬 I research the intersections of human service organizations, emerging technologies, and social theory, with a particular interest in digital literacies and open data infrastructures. Right now I am mainly focused on my qualifying exam and a few research projects.

- ⚗️ I'm curious about data visualization, digital art, design, and data justice. I like people who build tools and organizations that make the world a more just and equitable place.
- 🌱 Over the last several years I've learned a mix of programming languages (JavaScript, R, Python), research methods, and some foundations for developing a sustainable system for balancing an endless avalanche of work and projects that is #PhDlife.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him.
